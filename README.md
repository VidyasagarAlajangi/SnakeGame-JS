# Snake Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. The game allows the player to control a snake to collect food, which makes the snake grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:
   - Up: `Up Arrow`
   - Down: `Down Arrow`
   - Left: `Left Arrow`
   - Right: `Right Arrow`

2. Collect the red squares (food) to increase your score and the length of the snake.

3. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. If you do, the game will be over.

## Game Features

- **Canvas Rendering**: The game is rendered using HTML5 canvas.
- **Dynamic Speed**: The snake's speed increases as the score increases.
- **Score Display**: The current score is displayed on the canvas.
- **Game Over Message**: A "Game Over!" message is displayed when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
